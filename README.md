# EasyVisa Project: Visa Approval Prediction Model: Project Overview
* Analyze the data of Visa applicants, build a predictive model to facilitate the process of visa approvals, and based on important factors that significantly influence the Visa status recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied.
* Created predictive model through Ensemble Techniques to recommend suitable profile for applicants for whom a visa should be certified or denied
* Analyzed over 25000 applications to identify missing and duplicate values
* Optmized Bagging Classifiers (Bagging and Random Forest), and Boosting Classfiers (Adaboost, Gradient Boost, XGBoost) to construct initial model
* Hypetuned each model using GridsearchCV to determine the best model for production
